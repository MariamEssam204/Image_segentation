# Image Segmentation using K-means Clustering

Welcome to my image segmentation project! This repository contains the implementation of an image segmentation algorithm using the K-means clustering method. 

## Introduction

Image segmentation is a critical preprocessing step in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and image recognition. By dividing an image into meaningful segments, we can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of these tasks.

## Project Overview

In this project, I utilized the K-means clustering algorithm to segment images into distinct regions based on color similarity. This method helps in isolating different parts of an image, making it easier to analyze and recognize objects within the image.

## Key Features

- **Image Segmentation:** Divides images into meaningful segments based on color similarity.
- **K-means Clustering:** Implements the K-means algorithm for effective image segmentation.
- **Preprocessing for Object Detection and Recognition:** Enhances the accuracy and efficiency of subsequent computer vision tasks.

## Future Work
- Integrating with object detection algorithms
- Experimenting with different clustering techniques
- Improving segmentation accuracy and efficiency
